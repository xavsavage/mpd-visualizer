# MPD Visualizer

This is an MPD visualizer made with SDL and OpenGL.

This project was originally written a while ago with C++ and SFML, using the 
FMOD library to open, play and get info from an audio file.

This code has been cleaned and refactored to remove classes, and adapted to use 
SDL instead of SFML.
